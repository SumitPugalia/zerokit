Bare Minimum - a toolkit that provides the essential, no-frills functionality necessary to build up more complex systems.

# Consideration

1. Authentication and Authorization
User Authentication: Managing user sign-up, login, and logout.
OAuth and SSO: Allowing users to log in through third-party services (Google, Facebook, etc.) or corporate Single Sign-On (SSO).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigning roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the application.
2. Data Validation and Sanitization
Input Validation: Ensuring that data submitted by users meets expected formats (e.g., email, password strength).
Sanitization: Cleaning user input to prevent security issues like SQL injection or XSS (cross-site scripting).
3. Database Management and ORM
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Libraries like Sequelize (Node.js) or Hibernate (Java) map database tables to objects for easier data handling.
Database Migrations: Tools for versioning and migrating database schemas, such as Flyway or Liquibase.
Caching: Storing frequently accessed data in-memory for faster retrieval using solutions like Redis or Memcached.
4. File and Media Management
File Uploads: Handling file uploads, often integrated with cloud storage like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob.
Image Resizing and Compression: Processing images for different screen sizes and optimizing load times.
Document Generation: Creating PDF or Excel files from data, often for reports or invoices.
5. Messaging and Notifications
Email Sending: Sending transactional and marketing emails, often using services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES.
Push Notifications: Sending mobile or web push notifications to users via Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Service.
SMS Notifications: Sending SMS alerts using Twilio or similar SMS gateways.
6. Logging and Monitoring
Application Logs: Capturing logs for debugging and auditing with tools like Winston, Log4j, or Bunyan.
Error Tracking: Integrating with services like Sentry or Rollbar for tracking errors and exceptions in real-time.
Performance Monitoring: Tools like New Relic or Datadog for tracking performance metrics, server health, and real-time diagnostics.
7. Analytics and Tracking
User Behavior Tracking: Capturing events, page views, and actions with tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude.
A/B Testing: Experimenting with different features or layouts and analyzing user interactions using services like Optimizely or Google Optimize.
Conversion Tracking: Monitoring key metrics such as signup rates, purchase conversion, etc., to assess business performance.
8. Scheduling and Background Jobs
Task Scheduling: Running periodic tasks (e.g., cleanup scripts or report generation) using tools like Cron or libraries like Celery (Python).
Background Processing: Processing tasks asynchronously to improve responsiveness, often using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) or background job libraries like Sidekiq (Ruby), Bull (Node.js), or Hangfire (.NET).
9. Localization and Internationalization (i18n)
Language Translation: Preparing the application to support multiple languages.
Currency and Date Formatting: Displaying dates and currencies according to user locales.
10. Payment Processing
Payment Gateways: Integrating with services like Stripe, PayPal, or Square for processing payments, handling refunds, and managing subscriptions.
Currency Conversion: Automatically converting prices based on user location or account settings.
11. Security and Encryption
Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data (passwords, tokens) using libraries like BCrypt for passwords or OpenSSL for broader cryptographic needs.
Rate Limiting: Preventing abuse by limiting the number of API calls or requests per user/IP over a certain period.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implementing 2FA options for enhanced security.
12. Content Management
WYSIWYG Editors: Providing rich text editing capabilities in the application, using libraries like TinyMCE or CKEditor.
Content Management Systems (CMS): Integrating with CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Contentful, Strapi) for dynamic content management.
13. API Management and Documentation
API Gateway: Using gateways like Amazon API Gateway or Kong to manage and route API requests.
API Documentation: Generating API docs using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for better developer experience.
Rate Limiting and Throttling: Controlling API request limits to avoid abuse and ensure consistent performance.
14. Search and Filtering
Full-Text Search: Implementing search functionality using tools like Elasticsearch or Algolia.
Filtering and Sorting: Providing robust filtering and sorting capabilities in lists, tables, and search results.
15. CI/CD and Automation
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment: Setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.
Automated Testing: Using frameworks like Jest (JavaScript), JUnit (Java), or Pytest (Python) to automate unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
16. Data Export and Import
Data Export: Allowing users to export data in common formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF for external use.
Data Import: Parsing and validating uploaded data files for batch processing or migration purposes.
17. User Preferences and Settings
Customizable User Profiles: Allowing users to manage their preferences, such as themes, notifications, and privacy settings.
Dark Mode: Supporting dark mode as an alternative to the default light mode for user accessibility and customization.
18. Versioning and Rollbacks
Database Versioning: Keeping track of database schema versions and allowing for rollbacks in case of issues.
Application Rollbacks: Implementing mechanisms to quickly revert to previous versions of the application in case of deployment failures
